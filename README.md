# Cyber Republic Community Voting dApp

This dApp was initiated by a Cyber-Republic.org suggestion that aims at letting Cyber Republic community members vote for some community projects that possibly have been rejected by the Cyber Republic council. This is a way to let community members participate even more actively in Cyber Republic's operations.
