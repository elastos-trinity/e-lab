# ELAB dApp

This dApp was initiated by a Cyber-Republic.org suggestion that aims at letting Cyber Republic community members vote for some community projects that possibly have been rejected by the Cyber Republic council. This is a way to let community members participate even more actively in Cyber Republic's operations.

## How to use this dApp?

### Get a DID

An Elastos DID is required to sign in. You can get one from Elastos Essentials (https://elink.elastos.net/download), or GetDIDs (https://getdids.com) but currently, Elastos Essentials is the only wallet that implements the required DID features used by this voting dApp.

### Activate your voting account

To activate your account in order to create proposals or vote, you need to get your real identity verified. This is needed to ensure "one person, one vote". Your identity can be verified from a third party dApp such as "KYC-me", that lets you get KYC-ed, and gives you DID credentials that you import to Elastos Essentials. After that, you can provide those credentials to ELAB when requested.

- Enter the ELAB dapp, sign in.
- You will see a "activation required" message.
- If you have KYC-ed credentials, click "provide credentials" and choose the credentials in Essentials.
- If you don't have such credentials yet, first go to kyc-me.io and verify your identity, then come back to ELAB.
- Your account will then be active and you can vote for proposals, create proposals.

### Vote for proposals

- Enter the dApp, browse active proposals.
- Simply click yes or no on a proposal.
- Each proposal can be voted only once and the vote cannot be changed.
- Proposals are active during less than a month. Every 15th of months, successful proposals will be granted funds.

### Create a proposal

- Enter "My Proposals".
- Click "New proposal".
- Provide the required information.
- An admin will approve or reject your proposal according to the provided link.
- After approval, the proposal is open for voting by the community.
